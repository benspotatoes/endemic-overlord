# Notation
endemic-overlord, a name generated by the [namegen](http://rubygems.org/gems/namegen) Ruby gem, is my self-hosted note-taking (possibly todo-list) app hosted at [notation.benspotatoes.com](http://notation.benspotatoes.com).

### Why another note-taking app?
I was tired of looking for a perfect note-taking app: one that synced seamlessly across devices, had support for Markdown, and was fully customisable. This app matches all three!

### Why is this README so short?
I don't know what else to add. More to come soon...
